      <p>Charles Otto Puth Jr., born December 2, 1991 is an American singer and songwriter. His initial exposure came through the viral success of his 
        song videos uploaded to YouTube. Puth signed with the record label eleveneleven in 2011 after performing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, while songwriting 
        and producing material for other artists.</p>
        <p class="para2">After initially signing with eleven-eleven after performing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Puth began contributing to songs 
        and albums for other artists such as Cody Simpson, Livingston Taylor, and Skizzy Mars; as well as creating lite solo material 
        and covers of popular songs. With primary intent on a solo career, Atlantic Records eventually sought the artist and released 
        his debut single, "Marvin Gaye" featuring Meghan Trainor in 2015 to unanimous success. Coinciding with the single came his 
        first feature, "See You Again", which he co-wrote, co-produced, and performed with Wiz Khalifa for the Furious 7 soundtrack as 
        a tribute to Paul Walker. It peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks. After the success 
        of "See You Again", he gained worldwide recognition for multiple subsequent releases, including his next single "One Call Away". 
        The single reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped charts in New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p class="para3">Puth's debut studio album, Nine Track Mind, was released in January 2016 to negative reviews from critics, and was preceded by 
        the singles "One Call Away" and "We Don't Talk Anymore", which peaked at number 12 and number nine, respectively on the US 
        Billboard Hot 100.</p>
